    <div class ="about-text">
      <p><b>Welcome</b> to ASLearn, our web app designed to help you learn sign language in a fun and interactive way! Our app utilizes cutting-edge machine learning technology to detect your hand shapes as you spell out consecutive words in sign language.<br><br>

        As a final year project, our team of passionate developers and designers set out to create a tool that would make learning sign language more accessible and enjoyable. We understand that sign language is an important and valuable form of communication, and we wanted to make it easy for anyone to learn and practice.<br><br>
        
        Our app has two main sections. The first is a hand shape detector that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze your hand movements and detect the sign language gestures you are making. As you spell out consecutive words, the app provides feedback on your hand shape and helps you correct any mistakes.<br><br>
        
        The second section of our app is a text-to-sign language converter. This feature allows you to enter text and see it translated into sign language gestures. It's a great tool for practicing your sign language skills, and for communicating with individuals who use sign language as their primary mode of communication.<br><br>
        
        Our app is easy to use and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface. We've also included helpful tutorials and guides to get you started, and to help you get the most out of the app.
        
        We are committed to making sign language accessible to everyone, and we hope that our app can play a small part in achieving that goal. Thank you for using our app, and we hope you enjoy learning sign language with us!</p>
